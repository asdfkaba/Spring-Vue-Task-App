# Database backups

A daily `pg_dump` of the `spring` database, run by a systemd user timer on the server, next to the
`tasks` service. Dumps go to `~/backups/postgres/spring-<UTC time>.dump`, and dumps older than
14 days are deleted. Old dumps are only deleted after a new dump worked and could be read back.

## Install

On the server, as the user that runs the `tasks` service:

```bash
# 1. Script and units (from a checkout or copied over with scp)
cp deploy/backup/pg-backup.sh ~/tasks/ && chmod 700 ~/tasks/pg-backup.sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp deploy/backup/pg-backup.service deploy/backup/pg-backup.timer ~/.config/systemd/user/

# 2. Database user: replace CHANGE_ME with spring.datasource.username
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/pg-backup.service

# 3. Password for pg_dump (host:port:database:user:password), readable only by you
echo 'localhost:5432:spring:DB_USER:DB_PASSWORD' >> ~/.pgpass && chmod 600 ~/.pgpass

# 4. Try it once, then switch the timer on
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start pg-backup.service
journalctl --user -u pg-backup.service -n 20
ls -lh ~/backups/postgres
systemctl --user enable --now pg-backup.timer
systemctl --user list-timers pg-backup.timer
```

User timers only run while the user has a session, unless lingering is on. The `tasks` service
needs it as well, so it is probably on already: `loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger`
(otherwise `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`).

Settings, if needed, as further `Environment=` lines in `pg-backup.service`: `DB_NAME`
(default `spring`), `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `BACKUP_DIR`, `KEEP_DAYS` (default 14).

Use a `pg_dump` with the same major version as the server (`pg_dump --version`,
`psql -c 'select version()'`). A newer `pg_dump` works, but its dumps may not restore cleanly into
the older server.

## Off the server

The dumps are on the same disk as the database. They help after a bad migration or a mistake, not
when the server or its disk is lost. For that, fetch them regularly to another machine, e.g.:

```bash
rsync -a --ignore-existing USER@SERVER:backups/postgres/ ~/backups/taskz/
```

## Restore

Stop the app, restore into an empty database, start the app again:

```bash
systemctl --user stop tasks
dropdb -h localhost -U DB_USER spring      # or rename it first: ALTER DATABASE spring RENAME TO spring_old
createdb -h localhost -U DB_USER spring
pg_restore -h localhost -U DB_USER -d spring --no-owner ~/backups/postgres/spring-<time>.dump
systemctl --user start tasks
```

To look at a dump without touching the live data, restore it into another database
(`createdb spring_check` and `-d spring_check`).
